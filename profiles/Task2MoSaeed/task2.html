			If you are reading this then this warning is for you. <br>
			Every word you read of this useless fine website is another second off your life.<br>
			Don't you have other things to do?<br>
			Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments?<br>
			Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all
			who claim it? <br>
			Do you read everything you're supposed to read? <br>
			Do you think everything you're supposed to think? <br>
			Buy what you're told you should want? <br><br>
			Get out of your apartment. <br>
			Meet a member of the opposite sex. <br>
			Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. <br>
			Quit your job.<br>
			Start a fight. <br>
			Prove you're alive. <br>
			If you don't claim your 
			humanity you will become a statistic.

			<strong> This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time...  </strong>
